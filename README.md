Hi 👋🏻  I’m Mariko, a software engineer and healthcare professional —

☀️ 6+ years of experience within healthcare 🏥 and technology 💻space. I’m dedicated to improving healthcare outcomes and building full-stack applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node and Express.

👩🏻‍💻Co-created an open source developer tool called SafeQL 🔒 that parses GraphQL schema to detect security vulnerabilities. I recently gave a tech talk 🎤 on TypeScript that was sponsored by Jeeny and Bracelet.

🌿Staying curious and excited to grow professionally and personally, which can look like contributing to Open Source projects that have a mission and goal that resonate with me or perfecting my Mega Pilates game.
